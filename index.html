            <p class="intro-paragraph"> Welcome to the brand new Computer Architecture course! If you are new to the subject, let me present myself. I am professor Jason Schreier and I will accompaign you through the depths of the architecture of our metallic friends. Let me tell you I have been working in this industry since Moore proclaimed his law, oh what good times were those. I am sure you will appreciate this course as much as I do.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">First of all, we will start the course with Topic 1: The Fundamentals of Computer Design. This part is essential, as it will serve as a foundation for future topics. As a remainder, you can access the campus library to read the available bibliography (which is vital if you want to pass the course).</p>

                <p> Let's begin with a basic but important question. What is Computer Architecture? Well, Computer Architecture is the science and art of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance and cost goals. In the next video, you learn the basics of the computer architecture history.</p>
